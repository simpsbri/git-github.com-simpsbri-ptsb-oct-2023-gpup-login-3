# Group 3 - Code Titans

Shoparoo is a new startup aiming to take the throne from Amazon. It uses a simple setup where you can do everything on one page. Products, cart, and checkout are done on a single page.

This is a collaborative group project. Work together, communicate, and assign clear ownership to the work. Team projects means everyone is successful or no one is. Everyone must contribute, including engaging in the collaboration.

You’ll be building a full stack application. HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node/Express, and Postman are all required to complete. There are stories with requirements including an actual design vs the grey/black wireframe mockups we’ve done so far in class.

There is more work here than can be completed. Your group and support/product owner (Dan, Jahara, Demaceo) need to work together to decide which items to work on. There are items that are more important than others. Since we can’t complete everything but need to deliver some requirements/todos will have to be dropped. Remember - priority items and core functionality are typically the most important.

We will offer additional support with the above in mind but you are the drivers of this project. Execution and delivery is your responsibility individually and more importantly as a team.
